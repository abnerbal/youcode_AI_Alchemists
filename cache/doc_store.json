URL: acrux-ar-mountaineering-boot\\n\\nID: X000006368\\n\\nName: Acrux AR Mountaineering Boot\\n\\nDescription:\\nThe task was to create the lightest, most durable, best fitting, lowest volume weatherproof double boot ever made. The Acrux AR is the result. Designed for mountaineering, ice and mixed climbing, the Acrux AR combines the light weight and low volume of a single boot with the insulation, protection and quick drying advantages of a double boot. The comfort and support of Arc’teryx Adaptive Fit technology, unique laminated construction, and a wide range of innovative components and materials are all leveraged to meet the dynamic needs of the alpine climber’s foot and the rigorous demands of extreme environments. Years in the making, the Acrux AR is an unprecedented achievement that meets the full spectrum of performance demands.THE NEEDClimbers and professional mountain guides require use-specific performance across a range of alpine conditions and terrain. Their boot needs to provide support and security on mixed routes, ice climbs and glacial traverses. It needs to keep the foot warm, dry and comfortable, then dry quickly if moisture accumulates. It needs to withstand repeated use on rugged terrain. It needs to fit and provide a supportive platform. It needs to deliver all of this in a lightweight, low volume package for agility and freedom in extreme situations. Until now, some of these needs would have to be sacrificed to meet the others.CREATING THE SOLUTIONArc’teryx took the time to develop and meld new technologies so that the Acrux AR could satisfy the range of climbers’ needs without compromise. Arc’teryx Adaptive Fit technology uses a removable bootie that employs stretch textiles and minimal seams to create an instant custom fit with no pressure. With protection extended beyond the cuff of the boot and the highest level of breathability in this category, the bootie’s GORE-TEX membrane optimizes climate control and waterproof benefit. The perforated PE foam’s quick dry properties improve comfort, and a rubberized sole allows the bootie to be used as a camp shoe. The PE inner shell is preformed to compliment the bootie’s Adaptive Fit performance while providing insulation and a secure foothold.  Laminated Watertight™ construction and an exceptionally breathable GORE-TEX gaiter deliver total protection from water with a high level of abrasion and puncture resistance to offset potential damage from crampons and rock. The specially developed Vibram® AR outsole is designed for support and sure footedness. The tread and construction feature a semi-blocked toe, with anti-slip grooves, a medial climbing support zone, and heel created to provide braking on steep descents. The Vibram® Mont rubber compound maintains its performance in sub-zero conditions.\\n\\nShort Description:\\nA pinnacle of design for mountaineering, ice and mixed climbing, the Acrux AR is the lightest, most durable, and lowest profile insulated double boot available. AR: All-Round.

And we know that comfort is a performance essential - especially in a base layer. Focused for lower output activities in cool temperatures, and made from our brushed Torrent™ stretch polyester, the Rho hoody provides warmth, moisture transport, and is seriously soft. Its trim fit maximizes fabric performance and layers easily, and the hood provides options - wear it as a neck warmer, low profile hood, or full-face balaclava.\\nSize and Fit Tips: Fitted Fit - This trimmer fit is patterned to stay close to the body through the chest, waist, hip, and thigh. Its low profile eliminates bulk, moves with the body, and fits comfortably under our insulation and midlayers. This model's fit has evolved. Before you check out, please make sure to reference our sizing chart to determine your correct size.\\n\\nShort Description:\\nLight, comfortable trim-fit base layer for lower output in cool temperatures. *The Rho Hoody was previously the Rho LT Hoody.\\n\\nFeatures:\\n- Moisture-wicking\\n- Breathable\\n- Quick-drying\\n\\nGender Category:\\nWomen's\\n\\nCategories:\\n- Base Layer\\n\\nSubcategories:\\n- Lightweight\\n- Synthetic\\n\\nKeywords:\\n  keywordActivities: MOUNTAINEERING, mountaineering, mountain climbing\\n  keywordClimate: COLD CONDITIONS, autumn, climate, cold, cold weather activities, cool, extreme cold, fall, freezing, frigid, severe, temperature, temperatures, winter, winter layer\\n  keywordGeneric: ARC, all products, arc teryx, arcteryx, arc'teryx, B.C., bc, british columbia, canada, equipment, gear, innovation, innovative, outdoor, outdoor gear, performance, quality, sports equipment, technical, vancouver, ,BASE LAYER, baselayer, base-layer, PREMIÈRE COUCHE, première-couche, premiere-couche, sous-vêtements, sous-vetements\\n  keywordInsulation: BASE LAYER, thermal underwear, thermals, underwear, baselayer, base-layer, insulation\\n  keywordLocations: PLACE-MOUNTAINS, alp, alpine, ascent, back country, backcountry, crevasse, descent, elevation, expedition, high alpine, mid mountain, mountain, mountain pass, mountains, peak, peaks, summit, trail, trails, tree line, valley, valleys, wilderness\\n  keywordSpecific: thermal, thermals, underwear, underwear, base layer, undies\\n\\nManufacturing Facility:\\nVIET THUAN APPAREL COMPANY LIMITED (RSI)\\n\\nCare Instructions:\\n- Do Not Bleach\\n- Wash Dark Colours Separately\\n- Double Rinse\\n- Do Not Dry Clean\\n- Line Dry\\n- Do Not Iron\\n- Machine Wash Gentle Low\\n- Do Not Use Fabric Softener\\n- Remove Immediately\\n- Wash Inside Out\\n\\nIntended Use:\\n- Hiking and Trekking\\n- Skiing and Snowboarding\\n\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/product_textfiles/Rho_Hybrid_1_2_Zip_Neck.txt":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/product_textfiles/Rho_Hybrid_1_2_Zip_Neck.txt\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"hash\":\"Vsat1OcIp8g+ZBvMClo6K8syHU44ickk3eUK56a837A=\",\"text\":\"Product URL: mens/rho-hybrid-1-2-zip-neck\\n\\nID: X000006190\\n\\nName: Rho Hybrid 1/2 Zip Neck\\n\\nDescription:\\nA performance base layer for active adventure in cold weather, the Rho Hybrid’s Phasic™ AR II material stretches, provides thermal comfort, and is made with wicking fibres.
